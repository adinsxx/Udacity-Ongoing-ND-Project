    <h2>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web</h2>
       <div>
        <b>The Web</b>
            <p>
                The world wide web is comprised of a collection of HTML 
            (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>). Invented in the early 1990s, it now hosts
            close to 30 million HTML documents and is comprised of mainly HTML documents.

           <b>How It Works</b>
               <p>
                   The web is comprised of many computers called 'servers'. These computers only serve
                   the function of storing files; unlike a PC, which is primarily used to read the files off these servers.
                   For more information on how computers get that information, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzyfIiVZPJA">this link</a>

           <b>What Is HTML?</b>
               <p>
                   HTML (<em>or HyperText Markup Language</em>) form the majority of content on the web, as stated earlier.
                   HTML is text content, which makes up pretty much all text you see on a webpage.
               </p>

           <b>Tags and Elements; Inline vs. Block</b>
               <p>
                   Tags in HTML define the text placed in them. Tags can bold and italicize text, and even be used to create links out of certain pieces of text. HTML elements are the full phrase
                   with tags and the text its defining creating an overall 'Element'. For a more in depth analysis, check out <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/487234440923#">this video.</a>
                   Elements are also defined by two different segments: block and inline. So as not to botch the description of that, check out <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/487234380923">this link</a> to learn more.

  <h2>Lesson 2: Structured Documents in HTML</h2>
      <b>Utilizing Browser Tools</b>
           <p>
               As seen in the previous lesson, HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.
               Block elements form a 'box' around the content inside of them. The box itself is invisible, but that whatever is
               inside the box can be manipulated.
           </p>
       </div>
       <div>
         <b>Tree Struture and HTML</b>
           <p>
               Similar to a family tree, the 'tree structure' of HTML comes from the fact that HTML elements
               can have other HTML elements nested inside of them. In a browser, this can show up as a series of nested boxes (<em>yep, boxes on boxes</em>)
               and the boxes will have boxes inside boxes inside of boxes. Indentation is also a good way to note the nesting of HTML elements.
               It can be defined by the 'wave' on the left side of the document.

         <b>Text Editors</b>
           <p>
               When writing actual code, programmers use specific types of text editors. These editors are made to make the programmer's job easier when writing code.
